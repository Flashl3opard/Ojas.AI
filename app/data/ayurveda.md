# 🌿 The Three Doshas in Ayurveda  

Ayurveda, the **ancient Indian science of life**, teaches that our body and mind are powered by three vital energies called **Doshas**.  

These doshas are like **managers of your inner world** — keeping your body, mind, and emotions in balance.  
They are made from the **five elements**: 🌍 Earth, 💧 Water, 🔥 Fire, 🌬️ Air, and ☁️ Ether (space).  

✨ **Think of them as your body's team leads**:
- 🌬️ **Vata** → The **Wind Manager** (movement, communication, creativity)  
- 🔥 **Pitta** → The **Fire Manager** (digestion, transformation, intelligence)  
- 🌎💧 **Kapha** → The **Earth/Water Manager** (structure, stability, calmness)
