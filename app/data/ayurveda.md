\# The Three Doshas in Ayurveda



Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, explains that life is governed by three vital energies called **Doshas**.  

These doshas are made from the **five elements** (Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether) and control all physical and mental processes.



Think of them as **managers of the body**:

\- **Vata** → The **Wind** manager (movement and communication)

\- **Pitta** → The **Fire** manager (digestion and transformation)

\- **Kapha** → The **Earth/Water** manager (structure and stability)
